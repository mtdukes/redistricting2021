# NC redistricting analysis
A collection of resources and notes for the ongoing analysis of North Carolina's 2021 redistricting proposals by [The News & Observer](https://www.newsobserver.com/).

Largely sourced from the N.C. General Assembly's:

 - [House Redistricting Committee](https://ncleg.gov/Committees/CommitteeInfo/HouseStanding/182#Documents)
 - [Senate Redistricting and Elections Committee](https://ncleg.gov/Committees/CommitteeInfo/SenateStanding/154#Documents)

A work in progress.

For background, [read up from The News & Observer's Will Doran](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article255119247.html).
