# Preliminary findings
Below are some of the preliminary findings from a 2021 analysis of redistricting plans proposals by the N.C. General Assembly.

The analysis was conducted by Tyler Dukes, of The News & Observer, based on [data produced by Jonathan Mattingly and Greg Herschlag](https://git.math.duke.edu/gitlab/gjh/redistricting2020results) of the [Quantifying Gerrymandering project at Duke University](https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/2021/10/26/the-geopolitical-landscape-of-the-north-carolina-general-assembly/).

***NOTE: The results here are PRELIMINARY and are subject to change as additional verification, fact-checking, etc. takes place. If you spot any errors, please contact [Tyler Dukes](mailto:mtdukes@newsobserver.com)***

## Overview
TK

The results below use "Democrats elected" as an arbitrary measure to stay consistent with the Duke analysis. The findings would be identical (but reversed) if we used "Republicans elected."

## Findings

### Comparing overall outcomes
Each race includes two charts. One uses an ensemble of 100,000 maps that includes respect for boundaries of cities and towns as part of the redistricting criteria. The other uses an ensemble that does not.
