# Preliminary findings
***NOTE: The results here are PRELIMINARY and are subject to change.***

Below are some of the preliminary findings from a 2021 analysis of redistricting plans proposals by the N.C. General Assembly.

The analysis was conducted by Tyler Dukes, of The News & Observer, based on [data produced by Jonathan Mattingly and Greg Herschlag](https://git.math.duke.edu/gitlab/gjh/redistricting2020results) of the [Quantifying Gerrymandering project at Duke University](https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/2021/10/26/the-geopolitical-landscape-of-the-north-carolina-general-assembly/).

## Overview

### N.C. Senate proposal (SST-13)
In general, the results show that the proposed state Senate map (SST-13) drawn by Republicans in 2021 would elect one to two more Republicans than expected under most past electoral conditions, based on a collection of 100,000 computer-generated maps provided by the Duke team.

*Count of the number Democrats elected under SST-13 compared to 100,000 maps generated by Duke mathematicians according to the legislature's redistricting criteria, using statewide vote totals from 2020 presidential race re-sorted into districts.*

In particular, election results using this map show evidence of "packing" and "cracking" voters across districts as the percentage of Democratic voters increases beyond 40%.

*Percentage of the vote for Democrats in each district, ordered from most Republican to most Democratic, under SST-13 compared to 100,000 maps generated by Duke mathematicians according to the legislature's redistricting criteria, using statewide vote totals from 2020 presidential race re-sorted into districts.*

**More findings TK.**

*Note: The results shown here arbitrarily use "Democrats elected" to stay consistent with the Duke analysis. The findings would be identical (but reversed) if we used "Republicans elected."*

*The Duke team also generated map collections that don't consider municipal boundaries. Although some of those maps are available for review below, the bulk of this analysis will focus on maps that are weighted toward municipal boundaries.*

### Comparing outcomes by district
Each race includes two charts. One uses an ensemble of 100,000 maps that includes respect for boundaries of cities and towns as part of the redistricting criteria. The other uses an ensemble that does not.
